# swift-code-snippets
**Sharing my code snippets for XCode and Swift.**

Checkout also these repos for more snippets:  

1. [burczyc](https://github.com/burczyk/XcodeSwiftSnippets)  
2. [Mattt](https://github.com/Xcode-Snippets/Swift).  
This last one still does not have any snippet for Swift and can not be forked yet, but I'm sure cool reusable snippets will appear soon there.  
  
I've prefixed all my snippets with **bmr-** so can be easily found using autocomplete.
